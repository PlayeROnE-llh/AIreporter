## 🎯 What It Does

| Stakeholder | Example Output |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Pro Player** | “Your 2-base timing is 14 s late. Spending 50 % of the drop investment on +1 attack would yield +23 % DPS by 14:00 and avoid Viking exposure to Photon Cannons.” |
| **Coach** | “Opponent skipped early detection. Drill DT drop at 6:30 (drill-ID #B-14) to exploit the gap.” |
| **Caster** | “A nail-biter! The 12:30 doom-drop mirrors 2023 WCS finals Game 4—perfect clip for the highlight reel.” |
| **Casual** | “You floated 1 200 minerals. Queue more Gateways next time 😊.” |
| **Spectator** | “Auto-marked highlights at 7:45, 11:02, 13:37—ready for social media.” |
